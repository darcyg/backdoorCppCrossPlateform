# cppCrossPlateformSocketProvider

_/!\ Work in progress, not a stable release /!\_

__Main goal__

Fork my own project named : "pilebones/backdoorBash" but instead of using Bash language (wich only work on Unix operating system) this one will be work on Windows too with a C++ cross-plateform API developed from scratch (if it possible).
